//! The client portion of `tower-hyper`.
//!
//! The client module contains three main utiliteies client, connection
//! and connect. Connection and Connect are designed to be used together
//! where as Client is a thicker client designed to be used by itself. There
//! is less control over driving the inner service compared to Connection. The
//! other difference is that Connection is a lowerlevel connection, so there is no
//! connection pooling etc, that is the job of the services that wrap it.
